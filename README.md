#sumrs

A small utility for cli which sums numbers separated by lines.

The impetus was to easily sum a column selected from csv.

I'm sure other aggregation for cli tools exist, but it was almost
simpler to just write myself than to search.

Currently only parses numbers as f32.

Possible future updates:
- option for summing as integer.
- statistics (e.g. total rows)
- other aggregations (e.g. avg, median)
